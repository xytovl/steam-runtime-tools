# NAME

pv-verify - verify integrity of a pressure-vessel-based container

# SYNOPSIS

**pv-verify**
[*OPTIONS*]
[**--**]
[*DIRECTORY*]

**pv-verify --version**

# DESCRIPTION

**pv-verify** checks a pressure-vessel-based container runtime against
a manifest written with a subset of **mtree**(5) syntax.

If no *DIRECTORY* is given, the default is to try to discover the runtime
that contains pressure-vessel.

# OPTIONS

`--minimized-runtime`
:   Assume the *DIRECTORY* is a Steam Linux Runtime runtime in minimized
    form (removing empty files, empty directories, symbolic links and so
    on). This is normally the `*_platform_*/files` directory.

`--mtree`
:   Use a non-default filename for the **mtree**(5) manifest.
    It must currently be compressed with **gzip**(1) or compatible.
    The default is normally `mtree.txt.gz` in the *DIRECTORY*.
    If `--minimized-runtime` is used, the default is `../usr-mtree.txt.gz`
    relative to the *DIRECTORY*.

`--quiet`
:   Don't show informational messages if the runtime is successfully verified,
    just exit with status 0.

`--verbose`
:   Be more verbose.

`--version`
:   Print the version number and exit.

# ENVIRONMENT

`SRT_LOG`
:   A sequence of tokens separated by colons, spaces or commas
    affecting how output is recorded. See source code for details.

# OUTPUT

Unstructured diagnostic messages are output on standard error.

# EXIT STATUS

0
:   The runtime matches the manifest

Anything else
:   The runtime does not match the manifest, or an error occurred

# EXAMPLE

    $ steam steam://install/1070560     # Steam Linux Runtime 1.0 (scout)
    $ cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/SteamLinuxRuntime_soldier
    $ ./pressure-vessel/bin/pv-verify
    $ ./pressure-vessel/bin/pv-verify ../SteamLinuxRuntime
